# Daily Landing Page Challenge

Hello Everyone! 👋

Starting today, I’ve taken on a challenge to create a new landing page **every single day** using only **HTML & CSS**. Each day, I'll design a unique landing page that you can explore and even use for your own projects!

## About the Challenge

These landing pages are inspired by designs from **Pinterest** and **Figma**, bringing together modern aesthetics and clean layouts. I'll be focusing on crafting responsive and visually appealing pages, which can serve as templates or inspiration for your next project.

## Features

- **Daily Landing Pages**: One new landing page every day, designed from scratch.
- **Reusable Designs**: Feel free to use these pages in your own projects.
- **Pure HTML & CSS**: No frameworks, just HTML & CSS for simplicity and versatility.
- **Inspiration from Real Designs**: Inspired by popular designs on Pinterest and Figma for that polished look.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Browse through the folders for each landing page design.
3. Open the HTML file in your browser to view the landing page.

## Support
