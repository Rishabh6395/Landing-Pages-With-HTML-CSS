# Daily Landing Page Challenge

Hello Everyone! 👋

Starting today, I’ve taken on a challenge to create a new landing page **every single day** using only **HTML & CSS**. Each day, I'll design a unique landing page that you can explore and even use for your own projects!

## About the Challenge

These landing pages are inspired by designs from **Pinterest** and **Figma**, bringing together modern aesthetics and clean layouts. I'll be focusing on crafting responsive and visually appealing pages, which can serve as templates or inspiration for your next project.

## Features

- **Daily Landing Pages**: One new landing page every day, designed from scratch.
- **Reusable Designs**: Feel free to use these pages in your own projects.
- **Pure HTML & CSS**: No frameworks, just HTML & CSS for simplicity and versatility.
- **Inspiration from Real Designs**: Inspired by popular designs on Pinterest and Figma for that polished look.
